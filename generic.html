						<h2>Parental Involvement in Children’s High School Athletics</h2>
						<p>Michael P. Counter</p>
					</header>

					<p>Parental involvement in education and athletics are very important for the development of high-school students and high-school student-athletes in particular. According to a survey that was released from the National Federation of State High School Association there are nearly 7.8 million high school student athletes. Most of these student-athletes aspire to get recruited for a college team. The degree of parental involvement in children’s high school athletics, or the lack thereof, can have negative effects, particularly when support turns to pressure. Even though their intention may initially be supportive and encouraging, some parents of high school student athletes tend to rather encourage negative behavior and overpressure them. These parents are often referred to as helicopter parents. According to Foster W. Cline helicopter parents “are always hovering over their children, never allowing them to succeed or fail on their own (Cline and Fay 399).” Almost 60% of parents to young adults were helicopters parents in the early 2000s and this is thought to be on the rise according to Dr. Jesse Viner and Matt Zajechowski of Yellowbrick. The main reasons for high school student-athletes to leave competitive sports are burnouts (21%), lack of commitment (19%), and pressure/stress (13%) based on research, people interviewed, and the data from Wisconsin coaches and athletic directors. According to coaches the main reason helicopter parents to behave this way is that they are trying to live vicariously through their children experiences. There are more than 7 million high school athletes, but there are college roster spots for just two percent of them, and even less (only 1%) student-athletes get a “full ride” in the NCAA Division I level (Athletic Scholarship Statistics). </p>

						<h3>The developmental Origins of Fear of Failure in Adolescent Athletes</h3>
			
					</header>
					
					<p>Parental feedback can greatly impact an athlete’s performance in many different ways. Ranging from significantly boosting their child’s abilities to prominently lowering their self-esteem, parents continue to play an enormous role. Researchers, Sagar and Lavallee, conducted a study to look into the phenomenon to see how big of an effect parents actually had. “The aim of this was to examine the effect of parental feedback on young competitive athletes’ Perceived Motivational Climate (PMC), goal involvement, goal orientation, and motor performance” (Sagar and Lavallee, 2010).</p>
					
					<p>To go about this, Sagar and Lavelle decided to interview three different intact families with adolescent athletes, ages 13 and 14, which resulted in nine separate interviews (three athletes and six parents).  “Each mother, father and athlete was interviewed separately three times over a 3–4 week period. Interviews with parents ranged between 90 and 200 min and with the athletes between 60 and 106 min” (Sagar and Lavallee, 2010). In these interviews, they looked for the levels of parental punitive behavior, parental controlling behavior, and parental high expectation within each family, and then tried to find a correlation between those levels and the athletes performance.</p>
					
					<p>Parental punitive behavior consisted of criticism, punishment, and threat, which were employed whenever the athletes did anything that their parents considered to be a failure. “All three athletes reported that they disliked these practices as they were sources of pressure, tension, and worry for them. For example, they feared their parents' threats because they believed that, if carried out, they would end their sporting careers and ambitions” (Sagar and Lavallee, 2010). They were conditioned into associating making mistakes with a punitive response from their parents and that they would only receive love and support if they performed successfully, which added to their fear of failure because they felt their relationship with their parents was on the line.</p>
					
					<p>Parental controlling behavior involved the parents, particularly the dads, being highly involved in their athlete’s sport because they sought to control outcomes. They believed that their high involvement would result in their child winning competitions and which, in turn, would result in them being highly liked by their coaches. That, however, instilled more fear in those children because it added on unneeded pressure.</p>
					
					<p>Finally, parental high expectations consisted of parents expressing their disappointment to their children when they made mistakes and didn’t meet expectations. This contributed to their fear of failure and was found to be associated “with high levels of stress and pressure, low levels of enthusiasm and enjoyment among young athletes, impaired sporting experience, and decreased well-being.” (Sagar and Lavallee).</p>
					
					<p>“Parental sport socialization practices and responses to their child's failure, such as punitive and controlling behavior, and high expectation for achievement, [contributed] to their child's [fear of failure] development” (Sagar and Lavallee). In turn, that ended up adding on unneeded stress on their children causing them to worry about meeting their parents expectations taking away from their personal enjoyment in their sport. </p>
					
					<p>These findings can be directly correlated to the theories of motivation and stress. When looking at motivation, intrinsic motivation seems to always be a better source than extrinsic because then the athlete is involved because they are the ones that find enjoyment in what they’re doing. However, when parents get involved, they tend to take away that intrinsic motivation because the athlete is then thinking more about pleasing their parents instead of enjoying the sport, which, in regards to the continuum of motivation, leads to low self-determination. That then ties to different theories on stress and stress management. Parental involvement, if not used properly, can easily be a negative stressor in an athlete’s life.  The processing efficiency theory states that when a person is under stress, a fraction of their attention, that should be used to fulfill whatever task they’re working on, is used worrying about unrelated, irrelevant thoughts (ex. their parents expectations). </p>

						<h3>Parental involvement and athletes’ career in youth sport</h3>
			
					</header>
					<p>It has been proven, over countless studies, that negative parental involvement can easily have a negative effect on an athlete. But what about positive influence? Wueth, Lee, and Alfermann carried out a study to look into that and examine the pattern of involvement of parents in youth sport across career phases and career transitions.</p>
					
					<p>To test this, a series of interviews were carried out, interviewing 193 athletes and their parents. The interviews consisted of questionnaires which measured perceptions of “active involvement (AI), praise and understanding (PU), directive behaviour (DB), and pressure (PR)” (Wueth, Lee, & Alfermann, 2004).</p> 
					
					<p>After getting results from all participants, the researchers found that athletes who received low levels of pressure, but high levels of praise and understanding were found to have better performances. Along with that, “athletes with successful career transition during the 12-month period report a higher amount of [positive] parental involvement than athletes with no transition” (Wueth et al., 2004).</p> 
					
					<p>These results added confidence to the fact that any type of parental influence, whether positive or negative, has an effect on an athlete’s performance. This evidence “corroborated the assumption that both parents play an important role in an athlete’s career development” (Wueth et al., 2004).</p>

						<h3>Measurement of Perceived Parental Success Standards in Sport and Relations with Athletes’ Self-Esteem, Performance Anxiety, and Achievement Goal Orientation: Comparing Parental and Coach Influences</h3>
						<p>By Frank J. Schwebel, Ronald E. Smith, and Frank L. Smoll</p>
			
					</header>
 
					<p>According to the achievement goal theory there are two distinct achievement goal orientations – ego and mastery – that college athletes use to define their success.  For the mastery orientation, success is described as self-referenced and characterized by achieving personal goals and the level of maximum effort and dedication. An ego orientation achievement goal means that college athletes measure their success compared to others and emphasizes outperforming others, but with maybe the same or less effort. The mastery orientation explains mistakes as an opportunity for self-improvement, whereas in the ego orientation mistakes are seen as unacceptable and they consider punishment necessary. Mastery orientation has been related to increasing levels of achievement and positive motivational outcomes but ego orientation has been researched with more negative outcomes, such as increased performance anxiety or inconsistent effort. According to Schwebel (2016) “when comparing mastery and ego achievement goal orientations, individuals with mastery orientations tend to display increased enjoyment, intrinsic motivation and interest, and satisfaction. The motivational climate provided by parents has a big influence on their children’s’ ego or mastery achievement goal orientation. When the parents are driven by their own achievement goal orientation, this has an enormous influence on the athletes’ achievement goal orientation. Ames (1992) found that “a high mastery climate is linked to lower performance anxiety” and Lewthwaite and Scanlan (1989) found that “ mastery climates led to decreased sport performance anxiety and increased self-esteem” whereas ego climates had the opposite effects. Another point that was made is that tests for the differences between parent and coach correlations showed that there was a significant stronger relation between perceived ego standards and athlete ego achievement goal orientation (r =0.61).</p>
