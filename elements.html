						<h3>Parental Involvement in High School Student Athletes -  Website Layout and Focus</h3>
						<p>NOTE: Please read the introduction for a better understanding.</p>
			
					</header>
 
					<p>The success of a child and outlook on sports (whether a positive or negative one) is greatly affected on the involvement of a parent. A father or a mother can impact the way a child performs in any given sport or even how much he or she enjoys that sport. As way to summarize and highlight some of the do’s and don’t’s of parental involvement, we’ve worked on a website which compiles some of the research on teenage athletes and how and why a parent might do certain things, or avoid others.</p>
					
					<p>One of the reasons the website concentrates mainly on high school students is because physically and psychologically, it is a time in which kids are developing the most. During his or her teenage years, the child is often times vulnerable but interestingly enough, also able to learn and retain so much as he or she develops as a person. Due to this, as a child practices a sport or is involved in a team, parents can either enable that child to grow more and improve as an athlete, or could potentially act as a deterrent in his or her development. </p> 
					
					<p>For example, some of the positive things a parent might want to do are allowing your child to be interested and want to play whatever sport he or she chooses.  By doing so, it allows the child the the opportunity of many choices, things that he/she might naturally like or be confident in rather than something he or she feels forced to do. Once the child has chosen a sport, a parent should support his/her choice even if it is not one that the parent might have chosen.  Similarly, assuming the child hasn’t chosen a sport, a parent should also support the child’s decision to not play a sport or not continue to play one if that’s what he or she feels more comfortable with. </p>
					
					<p>If your child is playing a sport and as he or she gets used to being a team, it important for a parent to emphasize the need to respect his/her coach.  A way a parent could teach a child to do this is by showing respect to the coach his/herself.  Since a coach, as previously seen, is another vital component to the success and progress of an athlete, it’s important for the child to respect and listen to his/her coach. As things get further into the season, a parent should not try to be too hard on their child or guard them from mistakes. A parent should let their child make mistakes themselves and try to figure things out. This allows them to grow mentally, as they analyze their own errors and made adjustments in order to correct them. This will help the parent in easing control and reign over the child’s athletic life, as they should ultimately gain a bit more power in terms of making decisions and choices in what’s best for them.</p>
					
					<p>On the other hand, some of the things a parent should avoid doing are projecting his or her life on their child’s. Just because the parent wanted to be a soccer player or a baseball player, it doesn’t mean that their child should live out that dream for the sake of the parent. A parent should accept that their child might be very different and he or she might have excel in another sport. Another thing parents should avoid is blaming others for the success of the child. When he or she loses a match or isn’t playing well, it can sometimes be easy to point fingers at coaches, equipment, other players, etc., but this might ultimately teach non-accountability to the child. A child should learn to be a team player and also reflect on bad practices or loses, so that he/she grows.</p>
					
					<p>Frustration is definitely a big thing to avoid around youth athletes. As a parent, when your child has so much potential or is improving so much, one might lose sight of things and keep pushing the child to do more and work harder. In doing so, the child might associate negative feelings for that sport and become “worn out.” Also, if a child is doing badly, in order to encourage him or her to do better, a parent might push too much which can also cause frustration and lead to him or her to quit the sport. A parent shouldn’t expect perfection as it can be unattainable. Instead, such as a coach, a parent should aim for growth and improvement. When emphasizing these, a child will most likely have a much better outlook on sports and can notably start to do better.</p>

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					</header>
 
					<p>As a result of negative parental presence, an athlete’s enjoyment and overall involvement in their sport can be impacted in a less than desirable way. Without realizing it, parents are a major factor in the development of their son or daughter as an athelete. Regardless of how they are involved, they make a great difference on child’s outlook of the sport.</p>
					
					<p>A parent’s influence on their child is much different than that of a teammate or coach because they are able to have an impact outside of practice or competition. They are there on the ride home or before the player goes to bed and that interaction can cause all the difference.<p> 
					
					<p>Many people tend to focus on how players should be better with their peers or how a coach can improve, but there are not as many resources letting parents know how to be better supporters. That is where the problem tends to start. Parents think they are helping by pushing their athlete to extremes because in their mind, they are just making them a better player in the end, and to them that is what matters. Our research shows that actually is not the case, and that these parents are actually causing their athletes to be more worse off, leading them to have lower self-esteem and wellbeing as well as higher levels of stress.</p>
